        <h2>Timestruck</h2>
        <p>
          There’s a split second, after the ignition catches and the radio
          blasts out a loud loud song from high school, when time strikes—and
          you are effervescence, 17 again, drinking beer on a hot hot afternoon,
          barefoot friends and open tailgates ringing the swimming hole,
          heedless of potential or circumstance, you are fresh fresh, diving
          headfirst against the current, bubbles swirling up, you break the
          surface and you gasp, you gasp when you slip back into yourself, your
          stale-soda self, careworn and aware, fingers caught between the volume
          and the power button, your years pounding past, quick as teenage
          heartbeats.

        <h2>The Hill</h2>
        <p>
          I never learned to flatter, to dove like a wisp of white grace,
          instead challenging boys to footraces and tackling them into grass
          stains, tumbling down the hill like green walnuts, fragrant and
          bitter. Eloquent slang eluded me, so when my brothers’ friends teased
          I made a hard fist and aimed for the weak bird between their legs. I
          was alligator, jaw and scales, and they were white- bellied fish,
          polishing my incisors. If I wanted, I could be the hero. If not, there
          was always the hill breaking our fall, my bruised shins, a smudge of
          mud across my shoulder.

        <h2>Wait</h2>
        <p>
          In the bare branches of the hedge outside my window sits a cardinal,
          his handsome red coat fluffed against the wind and flakes of snow that
          drift from a clouded sky. We are huddled in defense against the cold,
          he with his vibrant feathers, me with my cup of tea. He breathes the
          frigid air in and out again as we wait. We are connected in our
          anticipation, sustained by our shared hope that spring will return to
          soothe our aching limbs and renew our fragile hearts with purpose. But
          until then, we focus on breathing. Once more, and again.
