## Topic: localStorage

### Methods and Properties:

1. setItem(key, value)
2. getItem(key)
3. removeItem(key)
4. Clear()
5. length

### Points to keep in mind:

1. Each document has its own local storage.
2. localStorage data for a document loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private" tab is closed.
3. The keys and values stored in the local storage are always in string format.
